Typical deliverables include\ndownloadable datasets and APIs, dashboards, and documentation that enable repeatable analysis and\nintegration into models and data platforms. The primary value for users is improved decision quality\nand efficiency: structured datasets reduce manual collection, while analytics and metadata help\nestablish lineage, interpretability, and compliance with usage terms. When integrating such sources,\nfinancial analysts often focus on coverage, update frequency, methodology transparency, and mapping\nto identifiers so the vendor’s data can be joined cleanly with existing security master and\nportfolio data. It is commonly selected for market data, pricing, valuation, product classification\nuse cases, where consistent product classification and valuation inputs are essential for downstream\nanalytics. Analysts should also evaluate licensing terms, data lineage, and refresh cadence to\nensure the dataset is appropriate for their intended research and reporting workflows.",

      VENDOR_DESCRIPTION: "Fitch is a credit ratings and research organization that evaluates the creditworthiness of issuers\nand debt instruments. It helps financial analysts by providing forward‑looking opinions on default\nrisk, loss severity, and relative ranking within capital structures, along with detailed research\nreports that explain key drivers, sensitivities, and scenarios. Core data products include long‑ and\nshort‑term ratings, outlooks and watchlists, rating histories, methodology documentation, sector\nresearch, and in many cases estimated recovery ratings and structured finance deal surveillance.\nAnalysts use these datasets to screen for credit quality, monitor downgrade/upgrade risk, support\nrelative value and spread analysis, and inform portfolio guidelines and counterparty limits. Ratings\nand accompanying research are particularly useful for fixed‑income valuation, stress testing,\ncovenant and structural analysis, and comparing credits across industries and geographies with a\nstandardized scale. In enterprise workflows, the data is integrated into risk systems, regulatory\nreporting, and investment policy monitoring, providing auditable evidence for credit decisions and\nongoing surveillance. It is commonly selected for market data, pricing, valuation, product\nclassification use cases, where consistent product classification and valuation inputs are essential\nfor downstream analytics. Analysts should also evaluate licensing terms, data lineage, and refresh\ncadence to ensure the dataset is appropriate for their intended research and reporting workflows.",

      VENDOR_DESCRIPTION: "Rearc is an alternative data, analytics, or workflow provider that complements traditional market\nand fundamentals data with differentiated signals. Depending on the vendor, this can include news\nand event analytics, sentiment and NLP‑derived indicators, web and app traffic, pricing scraped from\ne‑commerce, transaction and supply‑chain signals, capital markets flows, or credit and loan\nperformance datasets. For financial analysts, these products help detect inflection points earlier\nthan financial statements, validate management commentary, and improve forecasting for revenue,\nmargins, demand, or credit risk. Common deliverables include cleaned datasets, factor or signal\nlibraries, APIs/feeds, and research dashboards, often with metadata to support data lineage and\ncompliance. Analysts incorporate the data into screening, event studies, nowcasting, and risk\nmonitoring, and use it to triangulate theses with independent evidence. The key benefit is\nincremental information: alternative signals can reduce model lag, improve confidence in scenarios,\nand provide timely alerts for catalysts and downside risks. It is commonly selected for market data,\npricing, valuation, product classification use cases, where consistent product classification and\nvaluation inputs are essential for downstream analytics. Analysts should also evaluate licensing\nterms, data lineage, and refresh cadence to ensure the dataset is appropriate for their intended\nresearch and reporting workflows.",
